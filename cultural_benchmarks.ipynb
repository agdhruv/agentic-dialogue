While wearing shoes inside someone's home is generally avoided in many Asian cultures including Nepal, the more culturally significant action to avoid with feet specifically in Nepalese culture is pointing your feet at people or sacred places. The feet are considered the lowest and impure part of the body, and pointing them towards others or religious symbols can be seen as disrespectful.\n",
