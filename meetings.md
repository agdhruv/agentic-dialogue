## Jack:

- Better for workshop at ACL etc.
- cot vs conversation - set up a baseline -- dig into this more

Next steps:
- Decide venue + workshop + standards
- 4 page vs 8 page papers
- More experiments -- only after deciding on venue (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, etc.)
- COLM is more ML focused - COLING might be better
